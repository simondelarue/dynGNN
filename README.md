# Node embedding for dynamic graphs

This repository contains research about embedding methods for time varying graphs.

## Structure

* `GNN/` : Sequences of interactions are analysed using graph neural networks based embedding methods. For more information about usage, refers to `GNN/README`.
* `spectral/` : Classic embedding approach, based on spectral decomposition of the Laplacian matrix of a graph.
* `stream/` : An extension of the `spectral/` approach, gathering several graph algorithms specifically designed for edge streaming [UNDER DEVELOPMENT].
